           <!-- answer -->
           <li>var :</li>
           <p>in function: Variables declared with var are function-scoped, which means they are only accessible within the function in which they are defined.</p>
           <p>globaly:If a var variable is declared outside of any function, it becomes a global variable and is accessible throughout the entire script..</p>
           <li>let:</li>
           <p>Variables declared with let are block-scoped, which means they are limited to the block in which they are defined</p>
           <p>when it declare in a function then it can not access outside of the function</p>
           <li>const :</li>
           <p>Variables declared with const also have block-level scope, just like let.</p>

           <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">02. The use cases of null and undefined</h2>
           <li>null:</li>
           <p>null is a value that represents the explicit absence of any object value or a value that has been intentionally set to indicate the absence of value or an empty state.</p>
           <p>It is often used as a placeholder when you want to indicate that a variable or property has no meaningful value.</p>
           <p>we can use null to check if a variable or property intentionally holds no value.</p>
           <li>undefined :</li>
           <p>Variables that are declared but not initialized are automatically assigned the value undefined</p>
           <p>Function parameters that are not provided with a value default to undefined</p>
           <p>When we try to access an object property that doesn't exist, it returns undefined</p>

           <!-- answer -->
           <p>REST api:REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface</p>
           <p> It is a set of architectural principles and constraints used for designing networked applications and web services.</p>
           <p>Key principles and characteristics of RESTful APIs include:</p>
           <li> REST APIs use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to perform operations on resources.</li>
           <li>Resources can have multiple representations, such as JSON, XML, HTML, or plain text</li>
           <li>etc....</li>
